# 🔥❄️ Hot & Cold - Guess the Number Game (Java)

A fun and interactive console-based Java project where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. Along with "Too High" or "Too Low" hints, the game also gives **HOT 🔥** or **COLD ❄️** feedback based on how close the guess is.

## 📌 Features

✅ Random number generation between 1 and 100  
✅ User input using `Scanner`  
✅ Repeated guesses handled using `while` loop  
✅ Feedback system:
- 🔥 HOT if the guess is close (e.g., +/-10)
- ❄️ COLD if the guess is far from the original number (guess is greater than the number by 10 or lower than the number by 10)    
✅ Clean console interaction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java
- Console (Command Line)

## 📚 What I Learned

- Usage of `while` loops for continuous input
- Java `Random` class for number generation
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Logical operators and arithmetic conditions
- Improving user experience with feedback logic

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.java` file  
2. Open the file in your IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code)  
3. Compile and run the file  
4. Follow the prompts in the console and try to guess the number!

```bash
javac GuessNumberGame.java
